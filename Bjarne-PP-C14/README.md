C++ practice
============

This repository is simply all the practice programs I create as I learn C++. As well as any problems/challenges I am presented by the books I am reading. 

Currently the book I am using is "Programming Principles and Practice using C++" written by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is the second edition that uses C++ 11 and C++ 14. Most of the programs located in the repository will be a "try this" or assignment from this book.
